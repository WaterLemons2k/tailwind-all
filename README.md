# tailwind-all

All of Tailwind CSS (v3) in [one CSS file](dist/all.css).

---

Unfortunately, you [can't](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#config-directive) do this with v4:

> The `corePlugins`, `safelist` and `separator` options from the JavaScript-based config are not supported in v4.0.

## Development

```sh
npm run build
```
